## What's This All About?

[Happy Bin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.juhu.properbin&pcampaignid=web_share) is an android App with a simple goal: help users in Czech Republic (starting with Brno and Prague) find the nearest recycling bins. The idea is to make recycling easier and perhaps even a bit fun by introducing a few gamification elements (like points and leaderboards) -- WIP.
